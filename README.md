I'm a PhD student in biostatistics at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto. My current research focuses on dynamic treatment regimes (and causal inference, by extension), Bayesian methods and their intersections. I am also a core developper of [PyMC](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md?plain=1#L186), a Python library for Bayesian computation, where I primarily take interest in automatic log-probability inference, model visualization tools (via graphviz) and supporting (graduate) students to dive into the world of open-source (science). If you are interested in contributing or have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask on [Discourse](https://discourse.pymc.io/) or/and pick an issue [here](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/issues)!

At school, I am also part of the [Health Data Working Group](https://health-data-working-group.github.io/) where we provide programming-related (mostly Git, so far) workshops to aid students in public health for their studies and research. During my free time, I enjoy skateboarding üõπ and eating fruits üçê. Feel free to connect with me!
