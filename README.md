I'm a PhD student in biostatistics at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto. My research interests include dynamic treatment regimes, Bayesian methods and their applications in public health and medical research. Following my 2021 Google Summer of Code (GSoC) experience, I am now contributing more regularly to PyMC and, as part of [GSoC 2022](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/tSEKPZBa), diving deeper into Aesara and AePPL. During my free time, I enjoy skateboarding üõπ and eating fruits üçê. Feel free to connect with me!
